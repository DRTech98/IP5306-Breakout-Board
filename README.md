# IP5306-Breakout-Board
A breakout PCB designed with the intent to test the IP5306 charging IC on a bread board. 

The pin header spacing was based off of a 2.54mm scale, measured exactly so that it would properly fit onto a breadboard. The component selection of the PCB is based off of the values recommended in the data sheet.  

This board was assembled by hand, and the PCBs were ordered through JLCPCB services. The pin headers were difficult to solder due to the lack of thermal reliefs, but the other packages were selected as hand solder footprints, making the board fairly easy to assembly. 

The schematic contains proper labeling in terms of a basic description of the purpose of the PCB, along with some of the main features that the IC has based off of the description of the datasheet. 

Custom symbols and footprints were made and the project is split into several sub folders in order to keep everything organized. This project is a huge improvement from my previous designs, along with overall organization and documentation.
